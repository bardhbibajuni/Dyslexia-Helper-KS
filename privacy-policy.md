# Privacy Policy — Dyslexia Helper
**Effective date:** 2026-01-15

Dyslexia Helper is a Chrome extension designed to improve readability by applying user-selected fonts, spacing, and background colors on websites you visit.

## 1) Data We Collect
Dyslexia Helper **does not collect, transmit, sell, or share** personal data.
We do **not** collect:
- Personally identifiable information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Health or financial information
- Authentication data (passwords, credentials)
- Location data
- Web history
- User activity analytics (clicks, keystrokes, tracking)
- Website content (text/images) for storage or transmission

## 2) Data We Store (Local Settings Only)
To remember your preferences, Dyslexia Helper stores **extension settings** using Chrome extension storage on your device (and, if enabled by Chrome, it may sync across your Chrome profile). Stored settings may include:
- ON/OFF state
- Selected font
- Letter spacing and word spacing values
- Background color and background enable setting
- Terms acceptance state

These settings are stored **only to provide the extension’s functionality** and are not sent to the developer or any third party.

## 3) How the Extension Works on Webpages
When enabled, Dyslexia Helper modifies the appearance of webpages you visit by applying CSS styles (font, spacing, background color). This is done locally in your browser.

The extension does not access Chrome internal pages (e.g., `chrome://`) or the Chrome Web Store pages where access is restricted by Chrome.

## 4) Third-Party Sharing
Dyslexia Helper does **not** share data with third parties.

## 5) Security
We aim to keep the extension simple and privacy-respecting. Because the extension does not transmit user data, privacy risk is minimized. Settings remain within Chrome’s extension storage.

## 6) Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technical, or platform-related changes. Updates will be published on the same page. Continued use of the extension after changes means you accept the updated policy.

## 7) Contact
If you have questions or requests related to privacy, contact:
